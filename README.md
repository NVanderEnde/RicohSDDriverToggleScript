The Ricoh SD driver that comes with SD card enabled ThinkPad laptops will sometimes claim an entire CPU core and spin it furiously, while doing nothing. (This issue is documented here: https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/X-Series-ThinkPad-Laptops/Ricoh-Card-Reader-use-25-CPU/td-p/1124227) This script toggles the Enabled/Disabled state of the driver, allowing it to be easily turned off when not in use, sparing the poor CPU.
